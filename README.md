## Features / Technical

1. DOM manipulation to update on outcome per round and update score (template literals and string interpolation).
2. Game logic to compare player/computer choices and determine outcome per round.
3. Game logic to track scores and identify final winner and reset game.

## To do
1. Refactor/re-write game logic and use object (with player choices as key, and array with computer choices as array, each one indexed so player 0 = win, 1 = win, 2 = draw) and look up outcome as exercise.
2. Style!!!
